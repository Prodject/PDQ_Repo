Repository about PDQ Deploy/Inventory Tools, Utilities, Scripts ...
To Check, Repair, Change ...
This Repo is the root of PDQ Deploy's Repository.
These are my daily Tools to manage 2500 Workstations.

For the moment, i'll add .xml files and tools/scripts, one after another.
Sorry if you want to add everything at once, will see later.
Some parts have been translated into French.

I hope this will serve others.
